#Json.NET instrumented with tracing#

This is a fork of the official Newtonsoft.Json repository, where the code is instrumented with tracing logic through the use of metaprogramming constructs.

This fork is meant to serve as an evaluation sample for the proposed C# language extension implemented in [https://github.com/musashibg/roslyn/tree/decorators/](https://github.com/musashibg/roslyn/tree/decorators/).
